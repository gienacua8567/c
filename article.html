            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p><strong>Staying at home may be a welcoming change to some but to others may not. Maybe a choice to some but to others may not. For the health-conscious people who are staying at home either by choice or by consequence, and may have to stay home for a longer period of time, maintaining physical activity could be tough. Some may be used to going to the gym at regular periods of time to seriously workout to maintain their fitness. Others may be used to doing outdoor activities as a means of maintaining their health. But what if you can’t do all those things anymore... tt least not just yet.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>One of the things we need to watch out and probably need to adjust as well, during times of “extended stay at home”  will be our diet and nutrition. Since we don’t really move around as much unlike when we go to the office to work, or to school to study, we need to be conscious of our nutritional needs and keep it at a balance so as not to create the risk of developing health problems associated with sedentary lack of physical activity.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>On the other hand, while it can be a bit challenging, we can also address the situation by making sure to maintain physical activity even while at home. Let us first take a look at some of the challenges we might encounter. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>First, there is the space. Most of our physical activities require us to move around in some significant space to even consider our efforts as physical activity. With very limited space at home, it could be hard to even imagine yourself running around the house all day just to pop those sweat. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Second, the mood or ambiance. Sometimes, this would play a big role in encouraging and convincing yourself to take the time to exert effort in doing your physical activities. Whether it be moving around the office trying to perform your duties or “pumping iron” at the gym, just by being in that environment makes you put up the time and effort to maintain your health through various physical activities. Contrary to what you see at home, you do some stuff; sit around; do some more stuff while sitting around; look out the window, lie down; repeat. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>So what can we do about this? First, accept our situation and learn to adapt. Next, find out what sorts of activity you can do at home that would allow you to exert considerable physical activity like doing house choirs or… (can’t think of anything else?) 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Well, one thing is to create a plan that will allow you to do physical exercises on regular basis. But do keep in mind that this is not just about jogging in place or running the mill. Make sure that since you are making the plan anyway make it as complete as possible that your exercise will target and contribute to all the elements that make up your total physical health. That means that you do exercise not just for strength, but also for endurance, balance, and flexibility.
