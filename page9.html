            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p><strong>Moving around does not only reuire you to have strength but mostly to have flexibility as well. Afterall, we do not want to move like mechanical robots with stiff limbs and bodies. We want to be able to move freely and fluidly as possible to reach out in whatever direction or move about in whatever comfortable and convenient way we need to. Having good flexibility also helps us to avoid or help reduce the risk of inflictng muscular or even bone injuries to ourselves.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The best way to exercise or practice your flexibility is by doing "stretching" exercises. While some may contend that stretching is not that important in maintaining and improving overall health, we maintain that it is quite as important as the other types of exercises we mentioned. Stretching exercises allows the muscles in our bodies to maintain its flexibility to allow it to grow or improve. Remember how fitness experts or instructors will keep reminding us to do stretches or "warm-ups" before and after workouts?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>No doubt the best form of workout for this exercise is the yoga. But then again, if it's not your cup of tea,,, here is  a few simple  strecthing exercises you can do at home:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>1. Hamstring Stretch - Try to find a comfortable spot to raise one leg straight, preferably waist high. While keeping your raised leg staright and other leg firmly planted on ground. slowly bend forward and try to reach as far as you can and try to hold your position for a couple or few seconds. Switch sides as you repea the exercise.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>2. Seated Spinal Twist - Sit down on the floor with your legs straight in front of you. Starting with your right leg, bring your right foot over to your left knee. Bend the left knee so that your left foot will be as close to your buttocks as possible, keeping it flat on the floor. With your left arm, hook your right knee over and pull it as close to your body as you possibly can. You may stretch out your right arm with hands flat on the floor to support your balance. Hold the position for a minute or two then switch sides as you repeat the exercise.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>3. Neck Stretches - This is one of the most common stretch exercise that gives you great relief from most back, shoulder and neck pains due to stress. If you are sitting most of the time while working or studying or perhaps even having slept in a wrong position, waking up with a neck all stiffed and aching, then this might help relieve that kind of ache. Simply slowly pull your head to one side, as far as you comfortably can without applying  too much pressure with your opposite arm, holding that position for a few seconds. Release the pressure of the pull while still keeping support to your head until it's straight. Switch sides as you repeat.</strong></p></div>
